## Github quickstart

-   Click the green «Use this template» button to clone it to your own repo.
-   delete any apps or packages you don't need

## Quickstart (not Github/manually)

-   Clone the repo
-   delete the `.git` folder at the root of the project
-   delete any apps or packages you don't need

### Final steps

-   configure your own Sanity instance and add env variables ([more info](/docs/apps/sanity-studio))
-   run `yarn install` or just `yarn` if you prefer

:::admonition type="tip"
When working with a monorepo project it is highly recommended that you work with apps and packages in **separate VSCode windows**. For example if you are working with the one of the Next apps and Sanity Studio, open those two folders in separate VSCode windows. This will make debugging work, the inline terminal will get all the paths, and the .env files will be read correctly and so on...
